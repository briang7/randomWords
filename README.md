# randomWords

Random project when I was deciding between using Google's Firebase database and AWS Dynamodb for the Nature Finder App.  I ended up using Dynamodb for the App, but this project uses Google's Firebase.

I haven't taken the time yet to make it responsive / mobile.

Either click on the suggested words or use the number key pad to add the word to your story.  Press 0, Update, or the "." end of a sentance will shuffle the suggested words.  

The words are from a list of the 5,000 most common words.  I scraped the list from a website and wrote a little code that put it into a JSON.  Then from the JSON to the database.
